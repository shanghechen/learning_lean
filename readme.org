Some plans for learning lean4

* Theorem Proving in Lean (TPIL)
  - [X] 1. Introduction
  - [X] 2. Dependent Type Theory
  - [X] 3. Propositions and Proofs
  - [X] 4. Quantifiers and Equality
  - [ ] 5. Tactics
  - [ ] 6. Interacting with Lean
  - [ ] 7. Inductive Types
  - [ ] 8. Induction and Recursion
  - [ ] 9. Structures and Records
  - [ ] 10. Type Classes
  - [ ] 11. The Conversion Tactic Mode
  - [ ] 12. Axioms and Computation
* Mathematics in Lean (MIL)
TODO no crete plan yet
ref: [[https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean][Mathematics in Lean]]
* Category Theory in Lean
- [ ] Dean's Category and (Strict) Two Cateogry
- [ ] Yoneda Lemma
- [ ] TODO some other contents in Basic Category Theory
- [ ] the universal properties in category theory
* Learning MATHLIB
- [ ] algebra
- [ ] cateogry theory
- [ ] field theory
- [ ] logic
* Some concrete problems wanna prove in lean
- [ ] define integer using quotient, rather than [[https://github.com/leanprover/std4/blob/main/Std/Data/Int/Basic.lean][Std/Data/Int/Basic.lean]]
- [ ] some other quotient related things(TODO details)
- [ ] rudin's infnity in PMA
